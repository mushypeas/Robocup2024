# Notes

- The alternative packaging of hagelslag, liquorice, and crisps can be used
- The big cornflakes package you might still find in the arena will *NOT* be used, only the pictured version
- For fruits, fresh ones will be used during the test
- Strawberry, candle, and dishwasher tab are considered tiny objects
- Big coke is considered a heavy object
